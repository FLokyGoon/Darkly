#  Breach Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on Feedback Page
## Description of the Breach

This breach was identified on the feedback page of the website, where a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was exploited. By injecting a script tag into the input field, we were able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code and uncover a hidden flag.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to the Feedback Page:

	Start from the homepage and go to the feedback page:
	```bash
	http://localhost:8080/index.php?page=feedback
	```

2. Inject Malicious Script:

	In the input field named `name`, try entering the following partial script tag:
	```html
	<script>al
	```

	This triggers an XSS vulnerability, where the input is not properly sanitized, leading to the execution of JavaScript.

3. Retrieve the Flag:

	Upon submitting the form, the server processes the input without sanitization, resulting in the following flag being revealed:
	```
	0FBB54BBF7D099713CA4BE297E1BC7DA0173D8B3C21C1811B916A3A86652724E
	```

## Explanation of the Breach

The vulnerability here is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw on the feedback page. The application fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing malicious script tags to be executed. This can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, and data theft. In this case, the XSS vulnerability exposed a hidden flag.

## How to Fix the Breach

1. Sanitize User Input:

	Implement proper input sanitization and encoding to ensure that any user-supplied data is safely processed. This includes converting characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, and `"` to their HTML entity equivalents.

2. Use Content Security Policy (CSP):

	Deploy a Content Security Policy (CSP) that restricts the execution of scripts, especially inline JavaScript, and limits the sources from which scripts can be loaded.

3. Validate Input on the Server-Side:

	Ensure that all input validation occurs on the server side, in addition to any client-side validation. This adds an additional layer of security against XSS attacks.

4. Escape Output:

	When displaying user-generated content, ensure that all output is properly escaped. For example, use functions that convert special characters to HTML entities to prevent script execution.

5. Use Security Libraries:

	Leverage security libraries or frameworks that automatically handle input validation, escaping, and sanitization, reducing the likelihood of XSS vulnerabilities.
